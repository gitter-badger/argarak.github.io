# Argarak's Nexus
## Based on punch-blog

## Installing

If you, for some reason, want to run this website on your server run

    npm install
    
and then put this directory onto your server.

If you want to re-generate the site run `npm install` then `sudo npm install -g punch`
to install punch globally and then run `punch g` inside the website directory.

For testing run `punch s` to run punch's server.

Note when generating: copy index/index.html to the directory of the server so 
that it can run correctly.
