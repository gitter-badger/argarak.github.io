Hello, welcome to Argarak’s Nexus. This is a personal blog about the things I’m doing. I support free software and use GNU/Linux.
This is my personal blog about the things I’m doing and my opinions.

## How I do my computing

I have two computers, my desktop is custom built. I nicknamed it “Elephant”. It runs Parabola. The specifications will be on a separate page (coming soon)
My other computer is a IBM (Lenovo) Thinkpad R40e. It runs Debian. Usually not used.

* My window manager of choice is awesome (screenshot),
* I use IceCat but revert to Midori if something goes wrong,
* I use ncmpcpp to play my music,
* MPV for videos,
* I like to play Xonotic, ioquake, OpenTTD and others,
* Emacs for text edititng,
* uTox for chatting online (securely),
* tcpcrypt for protecting against the pesky passive “man in the middle” attacks,
* and Redshift makes computer work in the evening better. (By making everything less bright)

I only use free software except for my BIOS and my graphics card driver (the radeon driver needs to load propietary microcode).

I’m also interested in electrical engineering and working with microcontrollers and embedded GNU/Linux devices (especially the Beaglebone Black)
