As you may know, I'm Argarak. I am interested in programming, [music tracking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_tracker), electrical engineering and design. I am self taught in all of those areas and I have been developing software for a year, just about everyday.

I do not know what got me into programming, however I remember that it started with the [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) (would not recommend the second version due to Adobe Air) graphical language. I made little games or other interactive media. My first was a game based on the Star Control 2 graphics called "Mortal Melee", possibly stolen from that [Precursors](http://www.medievalfuture.com/precursors/main.php) remix with the same name. I used a Shofixti Scout for the ship an you used two attacks to destroy Kohr-Ah buzz-saws that flew towards you. The first was a weak laser that did not have great hit-detection. The second was a Melnorme shot that you could control with your ship's direction. 

After doing Scratch for a while, I decided to do Python afterwards. I grasped it quite quickly however, I only did very uninteresting programs such as some program that reverses some text or some [pygame](http://pygame.org/hifi.html) unfinished experiment. If you do want to learn Python try [Learn Python The Hard Way](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/index.html).

After that, I heard of a website called EdX. I made an account and started the CS50x course. At first it was simple, just Scratch. However after that we started learning C and creating programs that could print pyramids or a [greedy algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greedy_algorithm). Afterwards, it got even harder. From creating a game of [Breakout!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakout_%28video_game%29) to finishing a web server, I had fun.

I still have that final project to do. I don't know exactly what yet and I probably will have to get to that eventually.

Anyway, after CS50x, I was a bit lost. As you might know from one of my previous blog posts, "Loss of what to do", I explained how I was in a "limbo". I had a skill, but no use for it. That was until I started using Github, started creating some pieces of tat I'll remove eventually, but at least I was doing something. I also made a large achievement contributing to a project on Github by debugging it.

Today, I plan various projects and get them done! I love what I do and I no longer fear the shear complexity and challenge to work on them.

I hope you enjoy reading this blog as much as I do writing it!

Software I often use:

* awesome-wm - my favourite windowing manager due to its integrated status bar and simple [Lua](https://www.lua.org/) scripting.
* ncmpcpp - for playing music, well integrates with my window manager.
* redshift - so eye-strain is minimal
* icecat - it's clunky and heavyweight. However, it's the only good free browser when it comes to rendering websites (basically a copy of Iceweasel).
* emacs - the modular, customise-able, feature-full editor! What I've written this site with.
* termite with zsh - a simple terminal with a great shell - absolutely necessary to this day.
* mpv - light and filled with useful modifications - fork of mplayer. Great for online videos.

I use the Dvorak keyboard but I am awful at typing - ironic to say for a programmer. My computer's specs are quite low, but I don't mine crypto-currencies or play badly-written slow 3D games, so it's not very important.
